# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).


## [0.32.2] - 2026-08-19

### Fixed
- **Transformation Input Storage**: Fixed critical bug in `handleTransformationSend()` where user input was being read from `UI.elements.userInput.value` after it was already cleared by `prepareMessageSend()`, resulting in empty responses being stored and sent to the AI. Now correctly passes the original `userVal` parameter to ensure the actual user input is saved and evaluated.

---

## [0.32.1] - 2026-08-17

### Added
- **Researcher Menu**: Implemented indirect login via URL token (`?token=<token>`). Menu appears in bottom-right corner with the following options:
  - Export all conversations as **ZIP** (using JSZip library)
  - Export all conversations as **JSON**
  - **Delete server data** (requires valid token, deletes all dialogue logs from server)
  - **Statistics** (shows total conversations, turns, current conversation ID, etc.)
- **Backend Delete Endpoint**: Created `backend/delete_dialogue.php` for server-side data deletion with token validation.

### Changed
- **Token Storage**: Researcher token is now **only read from URL** (`?token=<token>`) and **no longer stored in localStorage**. This improves security by preventing persistent token storage in the browser. Menu visibility and server operations now depend solely on the URL parameter.

### Removed
- CSV export option (poor formatting)

---

## [0.32.0] - 2026-08-17

### Changed
- **Mode Selection Refactoring**: Simplified mode dropdown to only show **Simulation** and **Transformation** modes (removed Roleplay mode).
- **Mode Management Enhancement**: Added `APP_MODES.SIMULATION` constant and implemented `switchToSimulationMode()` function for proper mode switching.
- **Event Listener Updates**: Modified mode change event listener to explicitly handle simulation mode and route to the correct mode switcher.
- **UI Mode Badge**: Updated `setModeBadge()` to dynamically use the current mode for badge configuration.
- **Initial State**: Changed default mode from `ROLEPLAY` to `SIMULATION` in `STATE.currentMode`.

## [0.31.0] - 2026-08-11

### Changed
- Updated GitHub Pages workflow to deploy only `practice-edition` and `simulation-lab` branches. The `main` branch is excluded from deployment to prevent confusion. Branch names are automatically converted to lowercase with hyphens for URL safety.


## [0.30.0] - 2026-07-24

### Changed
- **Modular Codebase Structure**: Refactored the JavaScript codebase into a logical, feature-based folder structure under `src/js/` for improved maintainability and scalability:
  - `core/` - Application foundation (app.js, config.js, modeManager.js, state.js)
  - `features/` - Domain-specific modules (avatar.js, chat.js, export.js, feedback.js, profiles.js, scenario.js, speech.js)
  - `services/` - External service integrations (api.js, contentLoader.js, dataLogger.js)
  - `ui/` - User interface components (ui.js, uiHelpers.js, windowHandlers.js)
  - `utils/` - Shared utility functions (dropdowns.js, eventListeners.js, messageHandlers.js, utils.js)
- **Updated All Imports**: Adjusted 40+ relative import paths across all JavaScript modules to reference the new file locations.
- **Updated Entry Point**: Changed `index.html` script reference from `src/js/app.js` to `src/js/core/app.js`.

---

## [0.29.0] - 2026-07-22

### Added
- **Research Data Logging**: Implemented comprehensive dialogue turn logging via `DataLogger` module to capture all user and AI interactions for research purposes.
- **Automatic Upload Triggers**: Conversation data is now automatically uploaded to the backend server when switching modes, scenarios/exercises, starting new conversations, or clicking reset.
- **Backend Endpoint Integration**: DataLogger backend endpoint (`DATALOGGER_BACKEND`) is now properly configured and initialized on application start.

### Changed
- **Data Collection Workflow**: All chat messages (user input, AI responses, coach feedback) are now logged with rich metadata including mode, scenario ID, scenario title, and role names.
- **Auto-Upload Activation**: DataLogger auto-upload is enabled by default to ensure research data is consistently collected.

---

## [0.28.0] - 2026-07-05

### Added
- **Immediate Feedback Loop**: Transformation mode now provides instant AI feedback after each submission, allowing users to reflect on their phrasing immediately.
- **Iterative Practice**: Users can now choose to revise their answer based on feedback or proceed to the next task using a new "Next Task" navigation flow.
- **Structured Transcript Export**: Downloads now feature a cleaner layout with distinct roles ("Ich", "Coach-Feedback", and the Partner's role) for better readability.
- **Batch Evaluation Logic**: The final analysis in transformation mode now uses structured user answers instead of raw transcripts for higher accuracy.

### Changed
- **Smart Button Validation**: The "Send" button now dynamically enables/disables based on whether the input field contains text, preventing empty submissions.
- **Input UX**: Improved input field synchronization. The "Send" button correctly resets after switching tasks or using voice input.
- **Mic Button Persistence**: The microphone button now remains active while waiting for user input, even if the text field is empty, to encourage voice interaction.
- **Functional Modal Actions**: The download button within the feedback modal is now fully linked to the export logic.

 ---

## [0.27.1] - 2026-07-04

### Changed
- **Persona Adherence Logic**: Refined the `roleAdherence` instructions to more strictly prevent the AI from proactively ending the conversation, assuming the user's role, or breaking character.

 ---

## [0.27.0] - 2026-07-03

### Added
- **Type Safety & IntelliSense**: Introduced JSDoc `@typedef` for `AvatarConfig` in `avatar.js` to eliminate "unresolved variable" warnings and improve autocompletion.

### Changed
- **Defensive Programming**: Implemented Optional Chaining (`?.`) when accessing `UI.elements` throughout `app.js` to prevent runtime errors if DOM elements are missing.
- **API Robustness**: Secured API response processing (`data.choices[0]`) using deep optional chaining against malformed or empty returns.

### Fixed
- **Type Mismatches**: Resolved IDE warnings in `avatar.js` regarding nullable types and in `speech.js` regarding incorrect boolean return values and string comparisons.
- **Asset Handling**: Added existence checks for optional avatar layers (glasses, headsets) to avoid errors with incomplete character profiles.

 ---

## [0.26.0] - 2026-07-03

### Added
- **Persona Adherence Logic**: Implementation of a generic behavioral instruction (`roleAdherence`) that prevents the AI from proactively taking over the conversation or breaking character.

### Changed
- **Rebranding Finalization**: Renamed remaining technical identifiers (e.g., `MENTOR_TEMPERATURE` to `COACH_TEMPERATURE`) for full consistency with the "Coach" concept.
- **Simulation Persistence**: The currently selected scenario is now preserved during resets or mode changes, instead of jumping back to the first list entry.
- **Error Flow**: Optimized error handling in `api.js` and `app.js` by removing locally caught exceptions ("throw caught locally").

### Fixed
- **Async Integrity**: Fixed numerous "ignored promises" warnings in `app.js`. Core functions such as `startApp`, `confirmReset`, and `loadContent` are now correctly awaited within event listeners and modals.
- **DOM Binding**: Corrected event listeners for modal buttons (`modal-close-feedback`, `modal-close-reset`), which were non-functional due to missing registration in `ui.js`.
- **Session Continuity**: Replaced `location.reload()` with a dedicated reset logic to bring the application to a clean initial state without a hard browser refresh.
- **Code Cleanup**: Removed orphaned and unresolved variables (`_avatar`, `_avatarNodes`) from the UI module, which had been redundant since the modularization of the avatar logic.

 ---

## [0.25.1] - 2026-07-02

### Fixed
- **Session Continuity**: Fixed "New Conversation" and "Restart" actions to correctly preserve the active application mode (Simulation vs. Transformation) by replacing hard page reloads with dynamic state resets.
- **Modal Interaction**: Resolved issues with "X" (close) buttons in both the Feedback and Reset modals by implementing robust global handlers and direct HTML event triggers.

 ---

## [0.25.0] - 2026-07-01

### Changed
- **Persona Refinement**: Finalized the conceptual shift from "Trainer" to "Coach" across all logic, fallback prompts, and UI components.
- **UI Localization**: Unified all interface labels, status messages, and AI instructions to German for a consistent user experience.
- **Dynamic UI Features**: Implemented mode-aware titles for the analysis process ("Coach-Analyse" vs. "Mentor-Feedback").
- **Speech Synthesis Optimization**: Updated the voice engine to apply specialized instructional parameters (pitch and rate) to the new Coach persona.

### Fixed
- **Safety Fallbacks**: Added default evaluation prompts to `config.js` to prevent API crashes when scenario files are missing specific prompt metadata.
- **DOM Binding**: Added new IDs (`loading-title`, `feedback-modal-title`) to `index.html` and registered them in `ui.js` to enable targeted title updates.

 ---

## [0.24.2] - 2026-07-01

### Fixed
- **API Error Handling**: Resolved the `[object Object]` error by implementing robust stringification of error objects in the `handleFeedback` catch block.
- **Mode-Specific Prompts**: Fixed logic where transformation mode failed due to missing `mentor` prompts; the system now correctly switches to `trainer` prompts and includes safety fallbacks.
- **Feedback UI**: Ensured AI analysis is correctly stored in `STATE` and displayed immediately in the feedback modal.

---

## [0.24.1] - 2026-06-30

### Fixed
- **UI-Fehler**: Behebung eines `TypeError` in `ui.js`, da die Methode `setAvatarTalking` aufgerufen wurde, ohne definiert zu sein. Die Mundbewegung des Avatars wird nun korrekt mit dem Tipp-Indikator synchronisiert.

---

- **UI Decoupling**: Removed redundant manual ID remapping for mobile avatar nodes in `ui.js`, significantly reducing boilerplate code and improving maintainability.

### Fixed

- **Flash of Incorrect Content**: Resolved an issue where a default character was briefly visible before the scenario-specific character loaded by implementing a strict reset-before-preload logic in `avatar.js`.
- **Sync Issues**: Resolved a visual bug where switching between mobile and desktop views could lead to inconsistent avatar states.
- **Asset Loading**: Improved the robustness of the avatar update loop to prevent broken image icons when optional layers are missing.

---

## [0.20.0] - 2026-06-08

### Added

- **Service-Oriented Architecture**: Extracted core logic into standalone ES6 modules: `Avatar`, `Speech`, `Chat`, and `ScenarioService`.

---

## [0.9.1] - 2026-04-10

### Added

- **Dynamic Short Instructions:** Moved exercise-specific instruction strings (e.g., "Formuliere die Aussage konstruktiv um") from the source code into the `### META ###` block of scenario and instruction files using the `short_instruction` key.

### Changed

- **UI Consistency:** Synchronized the instruction text displayed in the main subtitle with the text shown in the initial chat bubble to prevent user confusion.
- **Data Architecture:** Updated `api.js` to parse the new metadata field and `app.js` to reactively update the UI based on the loaded exercise configuration.
- **Clean Code:** Removed the last remaining hardcoded German strings from the controller logic, making the application fully data-driven.

---

## [0.9.0] - 2026-04-10

### Added

- **Modular Architecture:** Split the monolithic `app.js` into specialized, namespaced modules: `api.js` (communication), `ui.js` (DOM/View), and `utils.js` (parsing/logic helpers) to improve maintainability and code clarity.
- **Centralized State Management:** Introduced a global `STATE` object in `app.js` to encapsulate chat history, configuration, and exercise progress, providing a "single source of truth" for the application.
- **Unified Initialization Helper:** Added `prepareModeSwitch` to standardize UI resets (clearing chat, scrolling to top, visibility toggles) when switching between modes.

### Changed

- **Stateless API Design:** Refactored `api.js` functions to be stateless; configuration values (URL, model, temperatures) are now passed as parameters from the controller (`app.js`), reducing hidden dependencies.
- **Decoupled Logic:** Moved heuristic role detection and complex text parsing from the controller to `utils.js`.
- **Orchestrated Data Flow:** `app.js` now acts strictly as a controller, orchestrating the flow between data services (`api.js`) and the user interface (`ui.js`).
- **Documentation Sync:** Fully updated `README.md` in both German and English to reflect the new modular structure, the dependency injection pattern, and the central role of `exercises.json`.

### Fixed

- **Global Scope Pollution:** Fixed issues where helper functions and variables were leaking into the global window object by using explicit namespacing (`window.UI`, `window.API`, etc.).
- **Reference Errors:** Resolved "assignment to undeclared variable" errors that occurred during the migration of global variables into the `STATE` object.
- **Race Conditions:** Improved initialization sequence to ensure `config.js` and `exercises.json` are fully processed before the UI starts interacting with modules.

---

## [0.8.0] - 2026-04-09

### Added

- **New Exercise Type:** Integrated "Positive Unterstellung" (Positive Assumption) into the Exercises mode, including dedicated statements, instructions, and trainer prompts.

### Changed

- **Mode Renaming:** Renamed "Gesprächstraining" to **Simulationen** (Simulations) and "Ich-Botschaften" to **Übungen** (Exercises) to better reflect the broader range of available content.
- **Layout Architecture:** Switched to a unified scroll layout where the main container (Briefing and Chat) scrolls as a single unit while the input area remains fixed at the bottom. This eliminates nested scrollbars for a better user experience.
- **Briefing Visibility:** Updated both modes to show the briefing expanded by default, ensuring immediate access to task instructions without hiding the first chat message.
- **Enhanced Scroll Logic:** Improved message appending to support conditional scrolling; the view now stays at the top when a new exercise loads but scrolls automatically during active conversation.
- **Refactored Mode Switching:** Made mode and scenario transitions more robust by properly awaiting asynchronous dropdown population and metadata loading.

### Fixed

- **Z-Index Hierarchy:** Corrected z-index values in `index.html` to ensure modals (Feedback/Reset) always appear above the sidebar and mobile overlays.
- **Scenario Dropdown Synchronization:** Fixed a bug where the scenario list wouldn't update correctly or fail to load the initial briefing when switching between Simulation and Exercise modes.
- **Layout Regressions:** Resolved issues where the input field was incorrectly positioned or covered by chat content on certain screen sizes.
- **Message Styling:** Fixed a logic error in `appendMessage` to ensure "Task" and "Feedback" bubbles in Exercise mode receive the correct visual styling and labels.
- **Mobile Sidebar Interaction:** Ensured the mobile menu closes automatically when opening modals to prevent UI overlapping.
- **Initialization Race Conditions:** Patched several async/await gaps in `app.js` that caused intermittent "Configuration not found" or "File not found" errors during rapid mode switching.

---

## [0.7.0] - 2026-04-08

### Added

- **Centralized Exercise Configuration:** `exercises.json` now serves as the single source of truth for all exercise types (Transformation and Simulation), replacing `scenarios/index.json` and `scenarios/ich_botschaft_mode.json`.
- **Dedicated Folder Structure for Transformation Exercises:** Introduced `scenarios/transformations/` for content files (e.g., `ich_botschaft_statements.txt`, `ich_botschaft_instructions.txt`) and `prompts/trainers/` for feedback prompts (e.g., `ich_botschaft_trainer.txt`).
- **Generic Transformation Mode Function:** Implemented `switchToTransformationMode` to handle all transformation-based exercises dynamically, making it easier to add new exercise types.
- **Unified Input UI Control:** Added `updateInputUI` helper function for consistent styling and state management of input elements across different modes and error states.
- **Modal-Sidebar Interaction:** Implemented logic to automatically close the mobile sidebar when a modal (feedback or reset) is opened, improving UX on smaller screens.

### Changed

- **Removed Redundant Configuration Files:** `scenarios/index.json` and `scenarios/ich_botschaft_mode.json` have been removed, as their functionality is now integrated into `exercises.json`.
- **Consistent Prompt Management:** Prompt references are now exclusively managed via `META` blocks in content files (e.g., `trainer_prompt` for transformation exercises), removing direct file paths from `exercises.json`.
- **Dynamic Exercise Titles:** Exercise titles are now dynamically loaded from `META` blocks in instruction/scenario files, removing redundant title fields from `exercises.json`.
- **Improved Text Rendering:** Implemented consistent use of `white-space: pre-wrap` for rendering text from `.txt` files and simplified rendering functions (`appendText`, `renderBoldMarkdownWithLineBreaks`) to avoid double line breaks and ensure accurate display of content.
- **Updated I-Message Content:** The content of `scenarios/transformations/ich_botschaft_instructions.txt` and `prompts/trainers/ich_botschaft_trainer.txt` has been updated for clarity, improved formatting, and adherence to the new `pre-wrap` rendering.
- **Refactored Mobile Menu Logic:** Simplified `toggleMobileMenu` function for clearer behavior and removed redundant scroll-locking commands.

### Fixed

- **Critical Bug: Double Reading of Response Body:** Corrected the `loadIchBotschaftStatements` function to prevent double reading of `response.text()`, which caused script errors.
- **Initialization Race Condition:** Resolved a race condition in `DOMContentLoaded` and `startApp` that caused "Configuration for I-Messages not found" errors by ensuring `exercises.json` is fully loaded before attempting to switch modes.
- **Robust Error Handling:** Removed hardcoded fallback values for scenario files and prompts in `app.js`. The application now displays explicit, user-friendly error messages and disables input if configurations or content files are missing or invalid, preventing interaction with an incomplete state.
- **UI State Consistency on Error:** Ensured that input fields remain disabled and error messages are prominently visible when loading fails, providing clear feedback to the user.
- **Syntax Errors:** Corrected various syntax errors and `this` references in `app.js` related to the `updateInputUI` helper function and the `switchToTransformationMode` function.
- **Z-Index Overlap:** Adjusted `z-index` values in `index.html` for modals, sidebar, and overlays to ensure correct visual layering.
- **`closeMobileMenuIfOpen` Scope:** Ensured `closeMobileMenuIfOpen` is defined in the global scope to be accessible by modal functions, resolving `ReferenceError`.
- **Enhanced API Error Reporting:** Updated `callChatApi` to provide detailed error logs including HTTP status and response text for better debugging.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-04-07

### Added

- **Scenario Validation Layer:** Added structured scenario parsing with explicit runtime validation for required markers and META fields (`system_prompt`, `partner_prompt`, `mentor_prompt`).
- **Central API Configuration:** Introduced centralized API constants in `app.js` (`PROXY_URL`, `MODEL`, `CHAT_TEMPERATURE`, `MENTOR_TEMPERATURE`) and a shared `callChatApi()` request helper.
- **Safe Text Rendering Helpers:** Added DOM-based rendering helpers to safely display chat and mentor text while preserving line breaks and lightweight `**bold**` formatting.
- **Dual-Mode Training Flow:** Added a mode switch for `Gesprächstraining` and `Ich-Botschaften`, including dedicated exercise actions (`Überarbeiten`, `Nächste Aussage`).
- **Externalized Runtime Config:** Added `config.js` as centralized frontend runtime configuration loaded before `app.js`.
- **Scenario Index File:** Added `scenarios/index.json` so dialogue scenarios are managed via data instead of hardcoded arrays.
- **I-Message Mode Files:** Added `scenarios/ich_botschaft_mode.json`, `scenarios/ich_botschaft_statements.txt`, and `prompts/system/ich_botschaft_feedback_prompt.txt` for file-based exercise content and prompt control.

### Changed

- **Secure UI Rendering:** Replaced critical `innerHTML` usage for model-generated message content with safe text-node based rendering to reduce injection risk.
- **Prompt File Format:** Cleaned up partner and mentor prompt files by removing wrapper syntax (`partner_de = """` / `mentor_de = """`), so prompts are now plain text only.
- **Documentation Overhaul:** Reworked `README.md` (DE/EN) to be hosting-agnostic, with clearer proxy/CORS guidance, scenario validation behavior, mode architecture, and new file-based configuration/prompt locations.
- **Exercise Source Cleanup:** Converted imported worksheet/training text assets into readable UTF-8/ASCII-safe `.txt` files for consistent editing.
- **I-Message UX Refinements:** Improved mode-specific UI clarity with hidden scenario selector in I-message mode, explicit mode badge, differentiated `Aufgabe` vs `Feedback` message styling, simplified labels, and clearer exercise action hierarchy including restart.

### Fixed

- **Scenario Error Handling:** Improved failure behavior for malformed scenario files by surfacing explicit format errors instead of continuing with incomplete state.
- **Mode Restore on Reload:** Fixed a state mismatch where browser-restored mode selection (e.g., `Ich-Botschaften`) could still initialize roleplay UI on page reload.
- **Mode Switch Consistency:** Fixed visual/state carryover when switching from `Ich-Botschaften` back to `Gesprächstraining` by enforcing a clean roleplay re-initialization (chat reset, input baseline, scenario reload).

## [0.5.0] - 2026-04-02

### Added

- **Visual Avatars:** Integrated `grafik.png` as a profile picture for female dialogue partners to enhance visual immersion.
- **Portrait Format Styling:** Implemented a new portrait-style avatar (rectangular with rounded corners) for female roles, while keeping standard roles circular for visual distinction.
- **Gender-Based UI Logic:** Added automatic detection for female roles using the "-in" suffix to dynamically switch between avatar styles.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-04-01

### Added

- **Smart Briefing Toggle:** Added a focus-based trigger for mobile devices. The briefing now automatically collapses when the user clicks into the input field on mobile to maximize screen space for the keyboard and chat.

### Fixed

- **App Initialization:** Fixed a syntax error in the `startApp` function (missing closing brackets) that prevented scenario files from being loaded into the dropdown.
- **Workflow Logic:** Ensured the briefing section collapses consistently across all devices upon sending the first message, keeping the UI focused on the conversation.

### Changed

- **Responsive Interaction:** Refined the balance between context and space: The briefing stays open on desktops during typing to provide reference, while it prioritizes space on mobile devices.

---

## [0.3.0] - 2026-03-31

### Added

- **Dynamic Scenario Loading:** Scenarios are now dynamically loaded from external text files, enabling easy addition of new training cases without changing the core logic.
- **AI Partner Simulation:** Integrated GPT-4o to provide high-quality, realistic, and sometimes defensive dialogue partners to simulate challenging leadership situations.
- **AI Mentor Analysis:** Added a comprehensive feedback system. The AI Mentor analyzes the conversation transcript based on specific communication phases and provides actionable advice.
- **Transcript Export:** Users can now download their complete conversation history along with the Mentor's feedback as a text file for documentation and further study.
- **Session Management:** Added a reset functionality to clear current progress and switch between different training scenarios seamlessly.

### Changed

- **Automated Role Detection:** Improved the logic to automatically extract the conversation partner's role from scenario descriptions for a more personalized UI.

---

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-31

### Added

- Responsive subtitle texts that adapt to screen width (Desktop vs. Mobile).
- Automatically collapse the briefing on initial page load for a better overview.

### Changed

- Improved focus management: The input field automatically regains focus after sending a message.
- Optimized Mobile UX: The sidebar now closes automatically once a scenario is selected.
- Refined role detection logic: Better handling of German grammar patterns (e.g., converting dative plural forms like "Mitarbeitenden").

---

## [0.1.0] - 2026-03-30

### Added

- Initial project structure including `index.html` and Tailwind CSS integration.
- Dynamic scenario loading from `.txt` files within the `scenarios/` directory.
- Chat logic in `app.js` for communication with the AI partner via a PHP proxy (`chat.php`).
- AI Mentor implementation to analyze conversation transcripts and provide constructive feedback.
- Role-specific prompts for both partner and mentor roles.
- UI Components:
  - Status indicator (System Ready / Loading / Error).
  - Feedback modal featuring a transcript download function.
  - Reset modal for restarting exercises.
  - Collapsible briefing section for task details.
- Project documentation (`README.md`) and Git configuration (`.gitignore`).

### Changed

- Optimized role detection: The counterpart's name is now automatically extracted from the task description.
- UI refinements for chat bubbles to enhance readability.

### Security

- Added sensitive files such as `chat.php` and `config.php` to `.gitignore` to prevent them from being committed to version control.
